# What is TZ List?

TZ List is a personal, actively maintained filter list designed for use with adblockers such as uBlock Origin, AdGuard, and others that support custom filter subscriptions.

It focuses on improving browsing experience by blocking unwanted ads, popups, trackers, malicious domains, and intrusive elements across popular websites.

# Why TZ list?

Many public filter lists are large and sometimes include unnecessary rules that slow down browsing.

TZ List aims to provide:
- Lightweight, optimized filtering for better performance.
- Personally tested rules tailored for clean and distraction-free browsing.
- Regular updates based on new ad/tracker patterns.
- Compatibility with both desktop and mobile browsers.

# What does TZ List blocks?

TZ List is built to block:
- Banner ads, pop-ups, and autoplay video ads
- Annoying cookie notices and subscription overlays
- Trackers and analytics scripts
- Fake download buttons and scammy redirect domains
- Intrusive elements that clutter pages (social share popups, etc.)

⚠️ Note: The list is not meant to break website functionality — rules are tested for compatibility, but false positives can still happen.

# How to use and enable TZ List

You can add the TZ List to your adblocker as a custom filter list using the following steps:

🔹 **For uBlock Origin:**

1. Open uBlock Origin dashboard → Filter lists tab
2. Scroll down to Custom
3. Paste this URL:
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tz-shuhag/tz-list/refs/heads/main/tz-annoyances.txt`
4. Click Apply Changes


🔹 **For AdGuard:**

1. Open AdGuard → Filters → Custom
2. Tap Add custom filter
3. Paste the same URL as above
